## `2.0.1` - 06/11/2020

- Update dependencies.

## `2.0.0` - 06/02/2020

#### Fixed

- Circle CI tag in readme is broken after namechange from MagicHQ to MagicLabs

#### Changed

- Removed the `magic-sdk/react-native` entry-point. To use React Native with Magic SDK, install `@magic-sdk/react-native` instead. There are no breaking API changes related to public SDK methods.

## `1.4.0` - 05/14/2020

#### Added

- `PromiEvent` interface for increasing the flexibility developers have when building 100% whitelabeled authentication flows using Magic SDK. This is a completely optional feature. Documentation is coming soon!

## `1.3.5` - 05/14/2020

#### Fixed

- Fixed a bug where React Native typings would pollute web environments not using Webpack.

## `1.3.4` - 05/14/2020

#### Fixed

- Alias the `Magic` constructor import to the SDK instance type. We have pretty complex extension typings which wrap the base SDK class, which was making typing a variable as `Magic` unnecessarily difficult! Now, you can use the constructor as the instance type as expected.

- Fixed a bug that would prevent typings from being available in a React Native environment.

## `1.3.3` - 05/14/2020

#### Fixed

- Fix a bug affecting Ethers JS V5 beta that would fail to attach the required ID parameter to JSON RPC 2.0 request payloads.

## `1.3.2` - 05/07/2020

#### Fixed

- The React Native entry point encountered an issue where `Buffer` is `undefined`. This is now resolved!

## `1.3.1` - 05/06/2020

#### Changed

- The React Native entry point now issues a warning if the `endpoint` parameter is used. This parameter should only be customized for web/browser targets. Existing implementations will continue to work with the warning.

- The default `endpoint` URL for React Native integrations is `https://box.magic.link`.

## `1.3.0` - 05/05/2020

#### Added

- Support for configuring [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/) network as the Etherum chain type. Further documentation is coming soon.

## `1.2.1` - 04/30/2020

#### Fixed

- Removed the `pako` dependency as it was negatively impacting SDK bundle size.

## `1.2.0` - 04/29/2020

#### Added

- The new `Extension` interface will soon enable Magic SDK to support official
  and third-party plugins!

## `1.1.4` - 04/28/2020

#### Changed

- Allow JSON RPC responses from the Magic `<iframe>` to be explicitly `null`.

## `1.1.3` - 04/28/2020

#### Fixed

- A bug on Safari that would lead to persistent `TypeError`s when using the CDN build of the library.

## `1.1.2` - 04/22/2020

#### Fixed

- Certain NodeJS globals/polyfills were not available in React Native environments. These polyfills are now bootstrapped automatically.

## `1.1.1` - 04/22/2020

#### Added

- Support for React Native:

```tsx
// Import the React Native bundle
// (Don't worry, the API is exactly the same!)
import { Magic } from 'magic-sdk/react-native';

const magic = new Magic('API_KEY');

function App() {
  return (<div>
    {/* Just render the `Modal` component to connect Magic SDK! ðŸš€ */}
    <magic.Relayer />
  </div>);
}
```

## `1.0.3` - 04/21/2020

#### Added

- `UpdateEmailFailed` RPCErrorCode for when update email fails.

## `1.0.2` - 04/15/2020
